    SET average_rating = (
        SELECT AVG(rating)

        WHERE content_id = inserted.content_id
    )
    WHERE content_id IN (
        SELECT content_id
        FROM inserted
    );
END;
Queries:

Retrieve a list of movies along with their associated genres and awards:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.content_id, c.nome AS movie_name, g.nome_genero AS genre, p.nome_premio AS award
FROM conteudo c
LEFT JOIN genero g ON g.content_id = c.content_id
LEFT JOIN premio p ON p.content_id = c.content_id;
Get the top-rated movies based on their average rating from the avalia table:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.content_id, c.nome AS movie_name, a.average_rating
FROM conteudo c
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT content_id, AVG(rating) AS average_rating
    FROM avalia
    GROUP BY content_id
) a ON a.content_id = c.content_id
ORDER BY a.average_rating DESC;
Views:

Create a view that combines information from multiple tables to provide a comprehensive movie overview:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW MovieOverview AS
SELECT c.content_id, c.nome AS movie_name, e.nome AS studio_name, a.average_rating
FROM conteudo c
LEFT JOIN estudio e ON e.estudio_id = c.estudio_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT content_id, AVG(rating) AS average_rating
    FROM avalia
    GROUP BY content_id
) a ON a.content_id = c.content_id;
Create a view that displays the total number of reviews and the average rating for each movie:

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW MovieReviews AS
SELECT c.content_id, c.nome AS movie_name, COUNT(a.content_id) AS review_count, AVG(a.rating) AS average_rating
FROM conteudo c
LEFT JOIN avalia a ON a.content_id = c.content_id
GROUP BY c.content_id, c.nome;
These examples should give you a starting point for creating indexes, stored procedures, UDFs, triggers, queries, and views based on your database schema. Remember to customize them according to your specific requirements and adjust the column names, parameters, and logic as needed.
